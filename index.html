I’m deeply curious about the world around me and try to learn about something new each day via: Subscribing to quality publications, having conversations with interesting people, teaching myself new skills, and always finding an opportunity to travel.

                        I hold degrees in engineering and finance, though I considered my university experience self-limiting creatively as it propelled me to launch an online fashion <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com.au/photos/arj-selvam?mediatype=photography&phrase=arj%20selvam&sort=mostpopular">brand</a> upon graduation in 2009. In a way it was pre-ecommerce, and certainly pre-Instagram, for better or worse. Since, I’ve zigged and zagged through my career, spending time at companies like <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> and <a href="https://www.aesop.com/">Aēsop</a>, and consider myself firmly acquainted and rooted in the world of technology, specifically the branch that is, <i>consumer internet</i>.

                        I am currently working on a mindfulness-inspired <i>personal care</i> project aimed for athletes and enthusiasts alike. The brand, <b>Minds and Recreation</b>, is the culmination of research on skin hydration and the mind-body relationship and it's effects on skin health. The brand is launching 2020.

                        After witnessing platforms come and go, and assessing my own approach to social media consumption and presence, I’ve decided it’s important to share content (photos, essays, etc.) under a system I ultimately own and control. Despite a headless CMS being an ideal solution for me here, it’s probably not justified financially yet for personal usage. Thus I’ve elected to use Wordpress — a very customizable solution. <b>Conscious Standard</b> is my new weblog, and you can visit it from the header.

                        Earlier this year, inspired by a Benjamin Franklin productivity piece, I decided to write my own personal values to serve as my own life's navigation, to keep me grounded, and help me live with more intent. What began as an unnecessary lengthy list has now been condensed to set of five words: Humility<label for="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Embody modesty and refrain or minimize from self-promotion</span>, resistance<label for="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Fight for what is right, be vocal for the people and things which matter to me</span>, consciousness<label for="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Engage intentionally and with volition</span>, color<label for="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Become lost in the arts, study what makes the world beautiful</span>, and compassion<label for="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Bring love and joy to people, self, and things</span>. When I'm stuck or need a prescription of self-awareness, I turn to these.

                        As I’ve gotten older I’ve found myself looking inwards a lot more and that has led me to the practice of daily meditation, running, and to a lesser extent yoga (Iyengar). These slow, ancient eastern rituals and rudimentary exercises have really helped me cultivate a more rounded, simpler<label for="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Henry David Thoreau. <i><a href="https://amzn.to/325q7cL">Walden; or, Life in the Woods</a>.</i> Ticknor and Fields, Boston, 1854.</span> , life; in addition to guiding me through adverse moments. Nowadays, I cannot imagine living a life without these tools.
