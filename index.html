                        I hold degrees in engineering and finance, though I consider my university experience to be somewhat self-limiting creatively. That propelled me to launch an online fashion <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com.au/photos/arj-selvam?mediatype=photography&phrase=arj%20selvam&sort=mostpopular">brand</a> after graduation (2009) which in some ways was pre-ecommerce and pre-Instagram, for better or worse. Since, I’ve zigged and zagged through my career, spending time at companies like <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> and <a href="https://www.aesop.com/">Aēsop</a>, and consider myself firmly acquainted and rooted in the world of technology, specifically the branch that is, consumer internet.

                        I enjoy documenting things: Life-updates, travels, monthly music playlists, personal health data, random thoughts, et cetera. Over the years, though, my documentation has become scattered across the web, which is to be expected. Thus, I recently spent time to consolidate my presence online.

                        Last year, inspired by a Benjamin Franklin productivity piece, I decided to write my own personal values to serve as my own life's navigation, to keep me grounded, and help me live with more intent. What began as an unnecessary lengthy list has now been condensed to set of five guiding words: Humility<label for="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">(One) Embody modesty and refrain or minimize from self-promotion</span>, resistance<label for="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">(Two) Fight for what is right, be vocal for the people and things which matter to me</span>, consciousness<label for="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">(Three) Engage intentionally and with volition</span>, color<label for="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">(Four) Become lost in the arts, study what makes the world beautiful</span>, and compassion<label for="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">(Five) Bring love and joy to people, self, and things</span>. When I'm stuck or need a dose of self-awareness, I turn to these.

                        As I’ve gotten older I’ve found myself looking inwards a lot more and that has led me to the practice of daily meditation, running, and to a lesser extent yoga (Iyengar).
