                        I hold degrees in engineering and finance, though I consider my university experience to be somewhat self-limiting creatively. That propelled me to launch an online fashion <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com.au/photos/arj-selvam?mediatype=photography&phrase=arj%20selvam&sort=mostpopular">brand</a> after graduation (2009) which in some ways was pre-ecommerce and pre-Instagram, for better or worse. Since, I’ve zigged and zagged through my career, spending time at companies like <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> and <a href="https://www.aesop.com/">Aēsop</a>, and consider myself firmly acquainted and rooted in the world of technology, specifically the branch that is, consumer internet.

                        Currently I am working on a personal venture, <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/palasystem/"><span class="smallcaps">PALA</span></a></b>, a personal care brand rooted in well-being and inspired by my health journey. Although <span class="smallcaps">PALA</span> is scheduled to launch later this year, I remain cognizant of the effects of this pandemic. Commerce truly takes a back seat to public health and when we do launch, we'll continue to acknowledge this and find ways to bring relief to those affected however great or small the gesture.

                    <p>
                        I enjoy documenting things: Life-updates, travels, reading lists, (quantified) health data, thoughts, et cetera. Over the years, though, my documentation has become scattered across the web, which is to be expected. Thus, I recently spent time to consolidate my presence online.

                        For non-regular life-updates, my personal weblog, <a href="https://consciousstandard.com/"><span class="smallcaps">conscious standard</span></a>, is where to go. I have mixed feelings for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arj.s/">Instagram</a>, even though it used to be one of my favorite social media platforms. Now, I post quite sporadicly and archive posts regularly to preserve the impermanence of our lives. I hope I'll find the joy I once held for this tool, but perhaps that may never come as nature and connections with people in the (real) world generate that fulfilment for me.

                        I'm constantly reviewing my personal values to serve as my life's navigation, to keep me grounded, and hold me accountable.

                    <p>
                        As I’ve gotten older I’ve found myself looking inwards a lot more and that has led me to the practice of daily meditation, running, and to a lesser extent yoga (Iyengar). These slow, ancient eastern practices have helped me cultivate a rounded and simpler<label for="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Henry David Thoreau. <i><a href="https://amzn.to/325q7cL">Walden; or, Life in the Woods</a>.</i> Ticknor and Fields, Boston, 1854.</span> life, but I still have (many) days where these practices don't quite hold up for the moment at hand. When that happens, I like to take a walk, speak with family or friends, or just doing nothing.
