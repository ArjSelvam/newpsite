                        I am the founder of <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/palasystem/"><span class="smallcaps">pala</span></a></b>, an entity rooted in well-being and inspired by my health journey. Although <span class="smallcaps">pala</span> is scheduled to launch later this year, I remain cognizant of this pandemic's impact. Commerce comes second to public health, so when we launch, we'll continue to acknowledge this and find ways to bring relief to those affected — however great or small the gesture.

                    <p>
                        When schedules align, I consult (advice, strategy, operations, hiring) for consumer technology companies founded by good people who are building conscious products or services.

                        I don't like the concept of listing career achievements, roles held at <em>high-profile</em> organizations, or the institution one attended. Understandably, it's not practical, but I've come to hold a higher regard for one's current outlook, than their previous accomplishments (or lack of). Like most, I have had career wins and career losses, and it's the career lows which have made me a better person. If credentials are needed, please email <a href="mailto:arj+cv@arjselvam.com">me</a>.

                        As I've gotten older, I've found myself looking inwards more, and that has led me to the practices of meditating, solo-running, and yoga (Iyengar). These slow, ancient eastern practices have helped me cultivate a simpler and balanced life  for me.

                        Last year, I wrote a set of (personal) virtues — inspired by Benjamin Franklin's — to help guide me. They're of course nothing more than collection of words with a hopeful demeanour; however, they link to a past experience which taught me something about myself — and now they're etched in memory.
