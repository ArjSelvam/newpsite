I’m deeply curious about the world around me and try to learn about something new each day via: Subscribing to quality publications, having conversations with interesting people, teaching myself new skills, and always finding the opportunity to travel.

                        I hold degrees in engineering and finance, though I consider my university experience self-limiting creatively to which it propelled me to launch an online fashion <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com.au/photos/arj-selvam?mediatype=photography&phrase=arj%20selvam&sort=mostpopular">brand</a> post-graduation in 2009. In a way it was pre-ecommerce, and certainly pre-Instagram. Since, I’ve zigged and zagged through my career, spending time at companies like <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> and <a href="https://www.aesop.com/">Aēsop</a>, and consider myself firmly acquainted and rooted in the world of technology, specifically consumer internet.

                        Earlier this year, inspired by a Benjamin Franklin virtues piece, I decided to write my own personal values to serve as my own life navigation, to keep me grounded, and help me live with more intent.

                        As I’ve gotten older I’ve found myself looking inwards a lot more of which has led me to practicing daily meditation, running, and to a lesser extent yoga (Iyengar). These slow, ancient eastern rituals and rudimentary exercises have really helped me cultivate a more rounded, simpler<label for="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ref-sn-viv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Henry David Thoreau. <i><a href="https://amzn.to/325q7cL">Walden; or, Life in the Woods</a>.</i> Ticknor and Fields, Boston, 1854.</span> , life as well as guided me through adverse moments. Nowadays I cannot imagine living a life without these tools.
